Features
Real-time Face Detection 🧑‍💻
Liveness Detection using facial landmarks 👁👁
Simple and Intuitive UI 🎨
Secure and Fast 🛡⚡
🎯 How It Works
📸 The application captures real-time video from the webcam.
🕵‍♂ It uses OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes in the video feed.
✅ A liveness check is performed by ensuring both eyes are detected in the frame.
💚 If liveness is detected, a green bounding box with "Liveness Detected" is shown. Otherwise, it indicates "Spoof Detected" with a red bounding box.
